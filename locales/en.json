    "faq_data_file_q": "What kind of data file do I need?",
    "faq_data_file_a": "- **Format**: A CSV file containing your electricity consumption.\n- **Required Columns**: The file must contain at least a timestamp and a consumption value (in kWh). The parser is designed to automatically detect formats from many providers.\n- **Granularity**: For the best results, especially for the *Usage Patterns*, data with **15-minute intervals** is recommended. Hourly data also works well. Daily data will have limited analysis capabilities.\n- **Getting Your Data**: Check your electricity provider's online portal. Many allow you to download your historical consumption data. The link in the sidebar provides more tips.\n- **Privacy**: The app does not store your data, but when deployed on a public server, the file is temporarily uploaded. It's recommended to anonymize personal information (like names or meter IDs) in the file before uploading, but do not delete the columns.\n\nPro Tip: [aWATTar backtesting](https://awattar-backtesting.github.io) provides detailed instructions for different network operators.",
    "faq_load_types_q": "What do the different 'load types' mean?",
    "faq_load_types_a": "The *Usage Patterns* tab classifies your consumption into three types:\n- **Base Load**: The continuous, minimum level of power your household consumes, even when you're asleep or away (e.g., refrigerator, standby devices). It's calculated by finding the most stable, low-consumption period each day.\n- **Regular Load**: The variable, everyday consumption above your base load (e.g., lights, cooking, TV).\n- **Peak Load**: Significant, short-term spikes in consumption, typically from high-power appliances like electric vehicle chargers, heat pumps, or washing machines. The analysis identifies these based on sharp increases in usage that are sustained above a high threshold.",
    "faq_peak_shifting_q": "How does 'Peak Load Shifting' work?",
    "faq_peak_shifting_a": "The simulation works by taking a percentage of your identified \"Peak Load\" and moving it from the most expensive hour it occurred in to the cheapest hour within a 4-hour window (+/- 2 hours).\n\nThis simulates the real-world scenario of programming a smart device (like an EV charger or a heat pump) to run during off-peak, cheaper hours, showing you the potential savings on a flexible tariff.",
